ABSTRACT = {Cardiovascular diseases, particularly coronary artery disease (CAD), remain the leading cause of death worldwide in recent years, with myocardial infarction (MI) being the most common form of CAD. Atherosclerosis has been highlighted as one of the drivers of CAD, and much research has been carried out to understand and treat this disease. However, there remains much to be better understood and developed in treating this disease. Genome editing technologies have been widely used to establish models of disease as well as to treat various genetic disorders at their root. In this review, we aim to highlight the various ways genome editing technologies can be applied to establish models of atherosclerosis, as well as their therapeutic roles in both atherosclerosis and the clinical implications of CAD.},
